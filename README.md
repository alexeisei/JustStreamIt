# JustStreamIt

This project is about developing a user interface for a web application.

It is a streaming site which aspect and functionnalities are based on the ones like Netflix.

The application makes asynchronous requests to an offline API called OCMovies-API (you can download and use it from https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR).
Those allow the update of the webpage by fetching needed informations from the API.

The webpage is written in HTML and its layout using CSS.
The scripts include :
- the fetching of informations for the best rated movie and the best rated movies from all categories, 
- a modal window to display the movies informations,
- a carousel to display the 7 best movies from categories.
